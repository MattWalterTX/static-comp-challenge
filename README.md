# static-comp-challenge

## Abstract
  - This is a webpage mock of a provided static comp picture (shown below) made using only HTML and CSS with no given assets.

## Technologies
- ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
- ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

## Features
- This page has no functionality or features as it is a mock.

## Possible Future Extensions
- I could not properly configure the individual card background images to be filtered properly without also effecting the child elements (arrow icon and view counter). Potential fix I am left with will require rebuilding that section of the cards and more manipulation of elements.
- None are required by the specs but could include adding log in and build options listed on the navigation bar with Javascript functionality to click through them.

## Learning Goals
- Youâ€™ll choose one static comp and to recreate. The objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design using only HTML and CSS.
- We have not provided you with any assets, nor native files. You will have to source assets on your own
